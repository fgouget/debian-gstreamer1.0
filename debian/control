Description: Core GStreamer libraries and elements
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains the core library and elements.

 This package contains unstripped shared libraries. It is provided primarily
 to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat
 easier to interpret core dumps. The libraries are installed in
 /usr/lib/debug and are automatically used by gdb.

# FIXME The official libgstreamer1.0-dev packages still divert the same binaries as
#       which makes them incompatible with it.
#       So the above dependency is there to ensure dh-gstreamer1.0 will only be
#       installed with versions of libgstreamer1.0-dev that will not break the divert,
#       and to ensure smooth upgrades and downgrades.
#       Eventually libgstreamer1.0-dev will no longer have the divert and then the
#       dependency can be replaced by the breaks+replaces below. Or the divert
#       could be dropped entirely once compatibility with the old GStreamer 0.10
#       packages no longer matters.
